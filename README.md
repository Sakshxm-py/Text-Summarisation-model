-Text Preprocessing: Tokenizes text, removes stopwords, and builds a word frequency table.

-Dynamic Input: Accepts user input interactively via the terminal.

-Summarization Output: Generates a summary from the most relevant sentences.

# Requirements:
-Python 3.x

-NLTK library for text processing


# How It Works:
